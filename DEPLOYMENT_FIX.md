# Deployment Environment Fix Required

## Issue Identified
The Storyblok region fix has been deployed, but Netlify environment variables still show the old configuration.

## Current Status
- ✅ Code updated (region: 'eu')
- ✅ Repository pushed  
- ✅ Deployment active
- ❌ Environment variables not updated

## Required Netlify Environment Variable Updates

### Update These Variables:
1. **STORYBLOK_REGION**: Change from `us` to `eu`
2. Verify **STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN**: `dI9HJYQcCfjLzXCUWpQF8wtt`

### Netlify Configuration Steps:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard for the site
2. Navigate to Site Settings → Environment Variables  
3. Update or add:
   ```
   STORYBLOK_REGION=eu
   STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=dI9HJYQcCfjLzXCUWpQF8wtt
   STORYBLOK_IS_PREVIEW=no
   ```
4. Trigger a new deployment or clear deploy cache

## Test URLs After Update:
- **Live Site:** https://storyblok-rumrivermn-netlify.netlify.app
- **Test Page:** https://storyblok-rumrivermn-netlify.netlify.app/test
- **API Test:** https://api.storyblok.com/v2/cdn/stories/home?token=dI9HJYQcCfjLzXCUWpQF8wtt

## Expected Results After Fix:
- Debug info should show "Region: eu"
- Error should change from "Unknown" to "404" (content not found)
- This confirms authentication is working, just need content

## Next Steps After Environment Fix:
1. Create content in Storyblok admin (follow CONTENT_SETUP.md)
2. Configure Visual Editor  
3. Test complete workflow
