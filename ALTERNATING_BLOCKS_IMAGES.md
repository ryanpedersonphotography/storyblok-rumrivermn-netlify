- **Content Context**: 400 acres of country charm, vineyards, oak forests, brook

3. Find the "Alternating Blocks Section" component

- Feature flag `FEATURE_CMS_IMAGES=0` keeps images disabled until uploaded
- Component mapping handles both asset objects and string URLs
- Full fallback to static content if CMS images unavailable
